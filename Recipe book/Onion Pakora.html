<h3 >About the recipe</h3>
<p class="about">Nepali onion pakora, also known as "pyaaji," is a crispy and flavorful snack made by deep-frying thinly sliced onions coated in a spiced gram flour batter. The batter typically includes ingredients like cumin, turmeric, chili powder, and sometimes rice flour for extra crispiness. It's a popular tea-time treat in Nepal, often enjoyed with chutneys or sauces.</p>

<h1>Steps:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>To a mixing bowl, add the following ingredients:</li>
    <li>2 cups sliced onions (moderately thin)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon minced ginger (or finely chopped)</li>
    <li>2 to 3 green chilies (chopped)</li>
    <li>10 chopped mint leaves (or 2 tablespoons coriander leaves)</li>
    <li>1 sprig curry leaves (chopped)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<p style="background-color: #DBD3D8;">Tip: Avoid slicing the onions too thin or too thick. They should be moderately thin. Check video to know how thin.
 Mix all of them well and squeeze the onions a couple of times so they begin to release moisture. Set this aside for 5 to 10 minutes.
 Sprinkle evenly the following</p>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup besan (gram flour)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoon rice flour (or cornstarch or semolina)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds, vaamu)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cashews (optional, soaked for 15 mins)</li>
    <li>You can also add half teaspoon garam masala if you want</li>
    <h4 >Make Dough</h4>
<ol type="a" style="background-color: #DBD3D8;">
   
    <li>Mix everything well. You get a dry mixture now.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 2 tablespoons water each time and mix the flour to make a moist dough. Do not pour water, just sprinkle to get the dough right. Sprinkle more water as needed.</li>
    <li>I used little over 1/4 cup, but it depends on the amount of moisture your onions release. The mixture must be tight but not too dry. It should not be soggy or dripping otherwise they soak up lot of oil and will not turn crispy. Taste test this and add more salt if needed.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a kadai until very hot. When it turns hot pour it to the dough. Gently mix with a spoon and not hand as it will be very hot. You can also skip this step.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Fry Onion Pakoda</h4>
<ol style="background-color:#EAE1DF">
<li>Next heat oil in the same pan for deep frying until medium hot. Check if it is hot enough by dropping a small quantity of dough in the oil, it must rise without browning and not sink.</li>
<li>This is the right time to begin frying. Take small portions, about a tablespoon and gently drop them in the oil. Fry on a medium heat stirring occasionally for even frying.</li>
<li>Fry the onion pakoda till golden and crisp. Lastly remove them to a colander or kitchen tissue. To fry the next batch ensure the oil is not very hot. Reduce the flame slightly and fry them.</li>
<li>Serve onion pakoda hot with a cup of tea or coffee. Sprinkle chaat masala if desired.</li>
